/**
 * The `FourMorning` class represents a scene in a game where the player navigates
 * through various choices and encounters at 4 AM. This class includes logic for updating
 * game states, managing player actions, and transitioning to subsequent scenes.
 *
 * <p>The scene features a textual description of the game's current situation,
 * player statistics (Conviction and Madness), and multiple button choices that allow
 * the player to explore the environment or make decisions affecting the storyline.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Features:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Dynamic game status text that changes based on player choices.</li>
 *     <li>Buttons for multiple actions, including investigating noises, choosing food,
 *     and transitioning to the next game hour.</li>
 *     <li>Stat tracking for Conviction and Madness, updated in response to gameplay actions.</li>
 *     <li>Visibility management for buttons to streamline the player's experience.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage:</h2>
 * <pre>
 * Stage primaryStage = new Stage();
 * FourMorning fourMorningScene = new FourMorning(primaryStage);
 * primaryStage.setScene(fourMorningScene.getScene());
 * primaryStage.show();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Dependencies:</h2>
 * This class requires `javafx.scene` components such as `Scene`, `Button`, `Text`, and `Stage`.
 * It also interacts with the `FiveMorning` class to transition to the next scene.
